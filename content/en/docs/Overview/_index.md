## What is RemoteScope?

RemoteScope operates an array of 20 telescopes in upstate New York. Operate the telescopes remotely from your home to explore the night sky and capture shots of your favorite celestial objects.

## Why do I want it?

For beginners, this could be your entry into astronomy, giving you a first glimpse at the wonders of the universe - our solar system, far-away galaxies, comets, nebulae, etc. Explore the night sky from the comfort of your home assisted by our trained staff.

For advanced users, our API allows you to integrate with our telescopes and automate your workflows. How far you can go and what you can do is up to you and your creativity. Be sure to [check out examples](https://remotescope.netlify.app/docs/remotescope-api/api-examples/) of how our customers have been using the RemoteScope API.

* **What is it good for?**: Basic and advanced users can explore the night sky, perform astrophotography and studies.

* **What is it not good for?**: People that don't want awesome things. Not you, but we all have that friend...

* **What is it *not yet* good for?**: In spring 2021, we'll launch RemoteScope Orbit, the first telescope in near-earth orbit available to the general public.
