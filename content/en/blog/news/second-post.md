The [conjunction between planet Venus and the Plaeiades star cluster](https://earthsky.org/tonight/venus-pleiades-couple-up-on-april-2-3-and-4) kicks things off on April 3rd and can be observed until April 5th. Telescope availability for those dates is already limited, so hurry to book your RemoteScope time. Book a RemoteScope expert for your timeslot to understand why this conjunction is so special and what the Pleiades really are.

Then, fingers crossed for [comet ATLAS](https://earthsky.org/space/how-to-see-bright-comet-c-2019-y4-atlas), which may put on one of the most spectacular shows seen from a comet since Hale-Bopp in 1997. We will keep you posted as th comet approaches earth, but you can already reserve your timeslot to view the comet.
